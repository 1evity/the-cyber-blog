            <p>
                This story is going to be the greatest story ever told, believe me. 
                It's about the most tremendous creature you've ever seen - let me tell you about the bat cat. 
                Bigger than any normal cat, yuuuge. This cat, with wings like a bat, could honestly fly better than those clowns at Boeing, I'm telling you. 
                Beautiful black fur, silky and luxurious - you've never felt anything like it. 
                Softer than mink but tougher than Chinese negotiators, that's for sure.
                <br>
                <br>
                The bat cat ruled his territory, circling high over the tallest towers. Every rodent, every bird, they all knew who was boss around here. 
                With his incredible sonar abilities - something brilliant scientists still don't fully understand - he could detect a mouse from miles away. 
                Unbelievable predator, an absolute killer.
                <br>
                <br>
                One day, the bat cat set his sights on a prize quarry - a huge, disgusting sewer rat. 
                This was the Moby Dick of rats, if you can believe it. Fat, ugly, a real slob just like the Democrat party. 
                But the bat cat wanted that repulsive rodent, oh how he wanted it.
                <br>
                <br>
                He tucked those gigantic wings and went into a breathtaking hunting dive, the batscat's version of landing the planes better than anybody. 
                Dropped out of the sky like a bat out of hell - which he basically was! The hapless rat never saw it coming until the last second when the bat cat's remarkable jaws closed around him.
                <br>
                <br>
                What a tremendous kill, probably the greatest hunt in New York City history. 
                The rat didn't know what hit him, whereas the genius bat cat knew everything that was happening. 
                I don't joke around about this stuff - ask anybody who understands natural instincts. 
                We're talking skills that would make Willard look like a total dope.
                <br>
                <br>
                That's the story of the most accomplished bat cat of all time, a true American success story if you want to know the truth. 
                The fake news media will never give this hero the credit he deserves, but we know who the real winner is, don't we folks? What a cat!
